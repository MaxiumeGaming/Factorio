# Factorio Unlimited Fuel Cells: Tileable Kovarex Blueprints

This folder contains the blueprints featured in the [Factorio Unlimited Fuel Cells: Tileable Kovarex Tutorial (FREE Blueprints)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddc0BgjMTRc) on my YouTube channel, Maxiume. These designs provide a scalable, tileable solution for creating an endless supply of uranium fuel cells.

## Included Blueprints

1. **Uranium Ore Processing**: A modular design to efficiently process uranium ore into U-235 and U-238 isotopes.
2. **Kovarex Enrichment Process**: An optimized, automated setup for multiplying U-235 using the Kovarex enrichment process.
3. **Nuclear Fuel Cell Production**: A straightforward and tileable design to turn U-235, U-238, and iron plates into nuclear fuel cells.

## Usage
