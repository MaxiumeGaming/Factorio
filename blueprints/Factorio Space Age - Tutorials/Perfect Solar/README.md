# Factorio Tileable Blueprints: Solar Grid Design (Perfect 0.84 Ratio)

This repository contains the blueprint book featured in the [Solar Grid Design Tutorial and Blueprint! | Factorio Space Age Ep. 26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTApZcX24-I) video on my YouTube channel, Maxiume. This solar setup is designed from scratch for a clean, grid-aligned layout that achieves the **ideal 0.84 accumulator-to-solar panel ratio**, perfect for large-scale megabase power.

## Included Blueprints

1. **Solar Grid Cell (Building Block)**  
   - A modular piece of the final solar grid, with perfect power pole coverage and roboport alignment.  
   - Used for prototyping, testing spacing, and adjusting ratios.  
   - Ideal for manual placement or blueprint tweaking before full deployment.

2. **Solar Grid Final Design (0.84 Ratio)**  
   - A complete tileable solar layout featuring 100 solar panels and 84 accumulators per grid cell.  
   - Includes roboports and substations for fully automated bot placement.  
   - Grid-aligned (100x100) for seamless expansion across your factory.

## Features

- ‚òÄÔ∏è **Perfect Power Ratio**  
  Optimized for the golden 0.84 accumulator-to-solar panel ratio for full night coverage.

- üìê **Fully Grid-Aligned**  
  Snap-to-grid layout allows for modular tiling across your base without power gaps.

- ü§ñ **Bot-Friendly Build**  
  Includes roboports and substations to ensure full logistic and construction coverage.

- üîã **Battery-Backed Solar**  
  Designed to function as a stable and scalable power source without relying on steam or nuclear.

## Usage

Copy the blueprint string from the files in this repository and import them into your Factorio blueprint library. Use the Building Block blueprint for manual adjustments or partial layouts, and deploy the Final Design blueprint for clean, high-efficiency solar farms.
