# Factorio Tileable Blueprints: RoboCell Grid Blocks (With & Without Lamps)

This repository contains the blueprint book featured in the [RoboCell Design Marathon! [FREE Blueprints] | Factorio Space Age Ep. 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG_-7L9bm1s) video on my YouTube channel, Maxiume. The RoboCell is a modular, grid-aligned blueprint designed to provide **perfect robot coverage** for both logistics and construction bots, ideal for structured factory building and future planetary expansion.

## Included Blueprints

1. **RoboCell (Standard)**  
   - Clean, minimal design with optimal coverage for both logistic and construction zones.  
   - Power poles are placed to avoid build-area interference.  
   - Snap-to-grid (102x102) positioning ensures flawless tiling in any direction.

2. **RoboCell (With Lamps)**  
   - Identical layout as the standard RoboCell, but includes indicator lamps for visual debugging, alignment, or aesthetic feedback.  
   - Ideal if you like visibility across your base, especially in low-light zones or to mark active zones during expansion.

## Features

- üì¶ **Fully Tileable**  
  Blueprint tiles seamlessly in all four directions.

- üîå **Efficient Power Layout**  
  Minimal power pole usage with complete coverage across RoboCells.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Zero Overlap, Maximum Utility**  
  Carefully adjusted to avoid redundant roboports and keep build zones clean.

- üß± **Modular Base Foundation**  
  Perfect for expanding mega-base setups or structured interplanetary factories in Space Age.

## Usage

Copy the blueprint string from the files in this repository and import them into your Factorio blueprint library. The book includes both variants. Simply pick your preferred version and tile away.
