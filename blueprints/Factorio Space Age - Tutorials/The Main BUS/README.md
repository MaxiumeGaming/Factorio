# Factorio Tileable Blueprints: Modular Main Bus Segments

This repository contains the blueprint book featured in the [Building The MAIN BUS! [FREE Blueprints] | 21 | Factorio Space Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmAhEf7RReM) episode on my YouTube channel, Maxiume. The blueprint book includes a **modular, grid-friendly main bus layout** designed for clean factory expansion, full Roboport compatibility, and mid-to-late game scalability.

## Included Blueprints

1. **Main Bus Segment: Iron Lines**  
   - 12 iron belt lanes organized into a compact, robot-friendly module.  
   - Built to handle heavy throughput for circuits and production chains.

2. **Main Bus Segment: Copper + Liquids**  
   - Includes multiple copper lanes and space for fluid handling.  
   - One extra liquid line for expansion/flexibility.

3. **Main Bus Segment: Intermediate Materials**  
   - Designed for steel, gears, green circuits, and more.  
   - Positioned for access to both bus sides with optimal belt spacing.

4. **Main Bus Segment: Advanced Materials**  
   - Reserved for red and blue circuits, modules, and late-game items.  
   - Clean bus access without interference from power poles or Roboports.

5. **Main Bus Segment: Overflow/Custom**  
   - Extra space for future expansion, custom needs, or overflow lanes.  
   - Use as a buffer or for specialized lines.

## Features

- üì¶ **Segmented for Flexibility**  
  Place only the parts you need, when you need them. Ideal for reactive and adaptive builds.

- ‚ö° **Roboport & Power Friendly**  
  Avoids conflict with power poles and roboport placement in your grid.

- üéØ **Snappable & Alignable**  
  All segments are grid-aligned and fit seamlessly within RoboCell layouts.

- üöÄ **Mid to Late Game Ready**  
  Supports Space Age scaling and integration with logistics bots.

## Usage

Copy the blueprint strings from the files in this repository and import them into your Factorio blueprint library. Each segment is tileable and independently placeable. Start small, expand smart.
