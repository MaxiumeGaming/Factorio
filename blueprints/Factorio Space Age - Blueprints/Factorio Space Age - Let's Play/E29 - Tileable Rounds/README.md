# Factorio Tileable Blueprints: Armor Piercing Rounds

This folder contains the blueprints featured in the [How To Build A Tileable Blueprint | 29 | Factorio Space Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbZHQHD1LQ) video on my YouTube channel, Maxiume. These designs provide scalable, tileable solutions for efficient factory operations, specifically for producing armor-piercing rounds.

## Included Blueprints

1.  **Armor Piercing Rounds (Start)**:
    * The initial segment of the armor-piercing rounds production line.
    * Designed to be the starting point for your tileable setup, handling the initial input of raw materials (copper, steel, iron) and producing normal rounds.
2.  **Armor Piercing Rounds (Tileable)**:
    * A seamless, repeatable segment for extending your armor-piercing rounds production.
    * Connects perfectly with the "Start" blueprint and other "Tileable" segments to scale production as needed, utilizing the normal rounds produced by the starter block and additional raw materials to craft armor-piercing rounds.

## Usage

Copy the blueprint string from the files and import them into your Factorio blueprint library.
